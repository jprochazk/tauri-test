# tauri-test

Example SvelteKit + Tauri application.

### Installation

Grab a package for your operating system from [releases](https://github.com/jprochazk/tauri-test/releases). 

### Local development

See [this page](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro#setting-up-your-environment), and install the dependencies for your operating system.

```
$ yarn && yarn tauri dev
```

This will open a new window. Changes to `src` trigger a reload, and changes to `src-tauri` trigger a recompilation and full restart of the application.
